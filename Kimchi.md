# Kimchi

The **Kimchi** is a traditional Korean fermented vegetable dish, typically made with napa cabbage and Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru). It's both a side dish and a condiment that adds a spicy, umami kick to any meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 napa cabbage (~2 kg)
- 60 g sea salt
- 60 g Korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 30 g rice flour
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 15 g ginger
- 30 ml fish sauce
- 30 ml salted shrimp (saeujeot), optional
- 10 g sugar
- 4 green onions, chopped
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 1 carrot, julienned
- 200 g daïkon
- 1/2 koren pear
- 180 ml water

## Instructions

### Step 1
Cut the cabbage into quarters lengthwise, then chop into 5 cm pieces. Salt the cabbage and let it sit for 2 hours, then rinse thoroughly and drain.

### Step 2
Make rice flour porridge: Mix rice flour with 180 ml water in a small pot. Heat over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens to a paste. Let it cool completely.

### Step 3
In a large bowl, make the paste by combining the cooled rice flour porridge, red pepper flakes, fish sauce, salted shrimp (if using), sugar, and remaining water.

### Step 4
Mix the koren pear, ginger, garlic and onion, then add it to the paste.

### Step 5
Add the green onions and carrot to the paste and mix well.

### Step 6
Add the drained cabbage to the paste mixture and mix thoroughly, ensuring all the cabbage is coated.

### Step 7
Pack the kimchi into a clean glass jar, leaving about 2.5 cm of space at the top for fermentation.

### Step 8
Let it ferment at room temperature (20-22°C) for 1-5 days, depending on your preference. The warmer the room, the faster it will ferment. Taste it daily until it reaches your desired level of sourness.

## Usage
Store in the refrigerator for up to several months. Serve as a side dish, use in stews, or add to fried rice.

> **Note** The longer it ferments in the refrigerator, the more sour it will become. You can start eating it right away, but it's best after at least 1-2 weeks of fermentation.
