# Mentsuyu

The **Mentsuyu** sauce is mainly used with Japanese noodles such as soba, udon and somen.
Here is my version of it.

## Ingredients

-   200 ml soy sauce
-   150 ml sakÃ©
-   200 ml mirin
-   10 gr kombu
-   25 gr katsuobushi 

## Instructions

### Step 1
Add all ingredients to a saucepan and mix well.
### Step 2
Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes.
### Step 3
Let the mixture cool.
### Step 4
Once at room temperature, strain the liquid and bottle it.



## Usage
Serve in a small bowl next to your noodles with a little green onion and finely chopped ginger.

> **Bonus** Recover the katsuobushi, dry it and you can use it as a base to make furikake.
